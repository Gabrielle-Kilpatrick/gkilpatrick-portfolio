Thank you for checking out my README page for my portfolio website. This portfolio was created using an HTML template from https://html5up.net/, edited for page changes and alterations. On this webpage, you can find information about me, such as my resume, work, and contact information. This page runs on a free static website through Microsoft Azure on my own custom domain. This page is linked to a Google Analytics account and is used to track user acquisitions, from location to how long a user rested on the page. You will find a cookies policy, privacy policy, and terms and conditions pages linked at the footer of the page.
